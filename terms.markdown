## TERMS AND CONDITIONS ##
The turnaround time on an order with BCCO NYC starts when you’ve paid in full and all required information has been received (i.e. all artwork, working /correct tags, all fonts required for editable tags, all shipping info, etc.). Delay in receipt of any of this information can, and likely will, result in production delays. Our current estimated turnaround time is between five and ten business days and does not including shipping time. Complex orders and add-ons may increase turnaround time. Delay in approval of mock ups, and additional finishing services can also result in production delays. The most up-to-date turnaround time will be listed on your quote and invoice.

If you have a deadline, it is necessary to inform us when placing your order. A rush fee may apply if there is not enough time to complete your order within our current margins. If you do not advise us of a due date until after your order has been paid for and production has been scheduled, we may not be able to accommodate your request, and additional charges may apply. Any circumstances out of BCCO NYC's control (i.e. weather delays, shipping errors by the supplier, etc.) may require additional time and are not included in turn around estimates.
